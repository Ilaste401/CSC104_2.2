		<h1>Bed in Summer</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>A short poem by <a href="https://robert-louis-stevenson.org">Robert Louis Stevenson</a></h2>
		<br>
		<p>In winter I get up at night</p>
		<p>And dress by yellow candle-light.</p>
		<p>In summer, quite the other way,</p>
		<p>I have to go to bed by day.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I have to go to bed and see</p>
		<p>The birds still hopping on the tree,</p>
		<p>Or hear the grown-up peopleâ€™s feet</p>
		<p>Still going past me in the street.</p>
		<br>
		<p>And does it not seem hard to you,</p>
		<p>When all the sky is clear and blue,</p>
		<p>And I should like so much to play,</p>
		<p>To have to go to bed by day?</p>
		<br>

		<h1>Who Has Seen the Wind?</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>A short poem by <a href="https://poets.org/poet/christina-rossetti">Christina Rosetti</a></h2>
		<br>
		<p>Who has seen the wind?</p>
		<p>Neither I nor you.</p>
		<p>But when the leaves hang trembling,</p>
		<p>The wind is passing through.</p>
		<p>Who has seen the wind?</p>
		<p>Neither you nor I.</p>
		<p>But when the trees bow down their heads,</p>
		<p>The wind is passing by.</p>
